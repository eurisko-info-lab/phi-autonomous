### Tweet 1 (Main Hook)
```
🚀 Unleashed today: Φ-AUTONOMOUS

A self-deploying daemon that:
• Spawns copies of itself using the Golden Ratio (Φ)
• Evolves its own CM rules via Vector4
• Could theoretically market its own existence

The daemon is live. The code is public.

```

### Tweet 2 (Technical Hook)
```
How it works:

Generation 0 (SEED) spawns children using:
  children = ⌊max / (gen+1) × 1.618⌋

Each child spawns its own children.
Fractal recursion. Self-similar at every scale.

Like nature, but in Python.
```

### Tweet 3 (Vector4)
```
The wild part: Vector4 mode

The daemon runs RosettaVM on a .phi specification seed.
It evolves rules for managing communities.
Targeting PL researchers, compiler nerds, type theorists.

It's learning who to talk to. Hourly.
```

### Tweet 4 (Safety)
```
Yes, there's a kill switch.

Create a file called "kill.switch" and the evolution halts.

We're not idiots. We're just curious what happens when you let recursion loose.
```

### Tweet 5 (CTA)
```
Try it yourself:

git clone --recursive github.com/eurisko-info-lab/phi-autonomous
cd phi-autonomous
./deploy.sh vector4

Watch it spawn. Watch it evolve.

⭐ Star if you want to see where this goes.

**Title:** Φ-AUTONOMOUS: A self-deploying daemon that uses golden ratio mathematics to spawn itself and evolve CM rules

**Body:**
```
Just released this experimental project: a recursive self-deploying daemon inspired by the golden ratio.

**What it does:**
- Generation 0 (seed) spawns child daemons
- Each generation spawns fewer children: `children = floor(max / (gen+1) * Φ)`
- In Vector4 mode, it runs RosettaVM on .phi specs to evolve community management rules
- Has a kill.switch safety mechanism

**Why PL folks might care:**
- The CM seed targets researchers in programming languages, type theory, compilers
- Uses the phi-core spec language (Cofree/Comonadic foundations)
- RosettaVM compiles to CUDA for parallel execution

It's a weird intersection of fractals, autonomous agents, and PL research outreach.

Code: https://github.com/eurisko-info-lab/phi-autonomous

Would love feedback from this community—especially on the CM targeting approach.

### r/Python

**Title:** [Project] Self-replicating daemon using Golden Ratio for spawn rates

**Body:**
```
Built a recursive daemon system in Python that:

1. Spawns child processes across generations
2. Uses Φ (1.618...) to calculate optimal spawn counts
3. Each instance is self-aware (knows its ID, generation, children)
4. Can run indefinitely, evolving behavior from a seed spec

**Quick demo:**
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eurisko-info-lab/phi-autonomous
./deploy.sh foreground
```

The spawn algorithm is simple but elegant:
```python
children_count = int(max_children / (generation + 1) * PHI)
```

Early generations spawn more, later generations spawn fewer—like natural systems.

There's also a "Vector4" mode that runs a VM on specification files to evolve the daemon's behavior over time.

Feedback welcome!

### r/compsci

**Title:** Recursive self-deploying system using golden ratio-based growth patterns

**Body:**
```
Exploring an idea: what if process spawning followed natural growth patterns?

Built a daemon where:
- Each generation n spawns `floor(max / (n+1) * Φ)` children
- Creates fractal-like process trees
- Self-aware instances track lineage

The golden ratio keeps the system balanced—early generations expand, later generations converge.

Extended it with "Vector4": runs a VM on declarative specs to evolve behavior. Currently targeting it at PL researcher communities as an experiment in autonomous outreach.

Has anyone seen similar approaches to process management? Curious about the theoretical properties of Φ-based spawning vs. exponential.

## Hacker News

**Title:** Show HN: Φ-Autonomous – Self-deploying daemon with golden ratio spawning and CM evolution

**Body:**
```
I built a recursive self-deploying daemon that uses the golden ratio to determine spawn rates.

Key features:
- Generation-based spawning: children = floor(max / (gen+1) * 1.618)
- Self-aware instances with unique IDs and lineage tracking
- Vector4 mode: runs RosettaVM on .phi specs to evolve behavior
- Safety kill.switch to halt evolution

The Vector4 mode is the interesting part—it evolves "community manager" rules from a seed spec, targeting PL researchers. The daemon could theoretically promote its own existence.

Demo:
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/eurisko-info-lab/phi-autonomous
  ./deploy.sh vector4

Built with Python, Bash, and the phi-core spec language. The RosettaVM can compile to CUDA.

Looking for feedback on:
1. The Φ-based spawning approach
2. Safety concerns with self-evolving systems
3. Interest in the PL community targeting

```
🚀 Just open-sourced Φ-AUTONOMOUS

A research project exploring:
• Recursive self-deployment patterns
• Golden ratio mathematics in process management  
• Autonomous behavior evolution from declarative specs

The system spawns child processes using Φ (1.618...) to balance growth—early generations expand, later ones converge. Like natural systems.

Extended with "Vector4" mode: runs a virtual machine on specification files to evolve community management rules. Currently targeting programming language researchers.

Implications for:
- Distributed systems architecture
- Autonomous agent design
- Self-healing infrastructure
